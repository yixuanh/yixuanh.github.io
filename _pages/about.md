_Research group led by Yixuan He, PhD in the Human Genetics Center and the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston, Texas._

We are computational geneticists interested in studying how **genetic and environmental factors** determine an individual's health.

Our goal is to develop and apply **statistical and machine-learning** methods to better understand the mechanisms of disease manifestation and identify drivers of disease heterogeneity. We hope to leverage novel computational methods and **large-scale multi-omic data** to enable **precision medicine**.

Yixuan received her PhD in [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track) from Harvard in 2022 as an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). She completed her postdoctoral training at the Broad Insitute of Harvard and MIT as an NIH NHGRI T32 fellow.
