**We are hiring! Please see job description [here](https://www.heylab.org/positions/) and contact me if you are interested!**

We are computational geneticists interested in studying how **genetic and environmental factors** contribute to disease manifestation and management. 

Our goal is to develop and apply **statistical and machine-learning** methods to better understand the mechanisms of disease manifestation and identify drivers of disease heterogeneity. We hope to leverage novel computational methods and large-scale **multi-omic data from diverse populations** to enable **precision medicine and equitable care**.

Yixuan received her PhD in [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track) from Harvard in 2022 as an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). She completed her postdoctoral training at the Broad Insitute of Harvard and MIT as an NIH T32 fellow. Yixuan will join the Human Genetics Center and Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics, and Environmental Sciences at UTHealth SPH as an assistant professor in January 2025.
