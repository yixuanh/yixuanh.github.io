We hope to leverage novel computational methods and <strong>large-scale multi-omic data</strong> to enable <strong>precision medicine</strong>.</p> <p>Yixuan received her PhD in <a href="https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics</a> from Harvard in 2022 as an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a>.
