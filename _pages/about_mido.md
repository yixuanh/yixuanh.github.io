Before moving to Houston, Yixuan (pronounced Yi-Shwin) earned a B.A. (2018) in Biology and Mathematics at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH. She then moved to Boston to pursue her PhD in [Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track) at Harvard Medical School in [Dr. Chirag Patel](https://www.chiragjpgroup.org/)'s group. 

After receiving her PhD (2022), she pursued her post-doctoral training with [Dr. Alicia Martin](https://armartinlab.com/) with co-mentorship from [Dr. Alexander Gusev](http://gusevlab.org/) and [Dr. Jordan Smoller](https://smollerlab.org/). During her two years of training at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, she developed a new polygenic risk scores approach which incorporated the genetic information of multiple traits across multiple ancestry groups. 

Yixuan is particularly interested in understanding the distinct and shared genetic architecture between chronic diseases like COPD and cancer. For a more formal account of Yixuan's academic work, please see her [CV](/assets/pdf/CV_Yixuan.pdf). In her free time, Yixuan enjoys baking, painting, and spending time with her dog, Mido.
